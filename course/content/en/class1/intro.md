## Research for Social Change - Introduction

At the heart of digital civics is an agenda for social change, but what could this actually look like? The impact agenda for universities means that as researchers we are increasingly encouraged to look at the social implications of our work.

In this session, we’re going to examine Professor Celia Kitzinger’s work as an example of an 'impact case study'. In 2009 she founded the Coma and Disorders of Consciousness Research Centre, with her sister Professor Jenny Kitzinger, after their sister Polly was catastrophically brain-injured in a car accident. 

Questions and links will appear in the transcript, please add your thoughts and reflections into the platform as you listen.
