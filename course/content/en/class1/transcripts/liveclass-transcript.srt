1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
Celia: And then as part of their stories they
of course went to town on, "Chris is just

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,480
lying there, she looks like a sleeping
beauty, her long fair hair fanned out

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,559
over the pillow her eyes closed
her chest her bre- her beautiful

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,940
breasts gently up and down with the
breathing machine". And you go okay, no,

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,050
she's probably seated in a wheelchair
because they have to drain the lungs and

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,830
they sit them up in wheelchairs, secondly
she's in a vegetative state that means

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,609
she has a sleep wake of cycle so as much
as you and I have our eyes open, she has

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,890
her eyes open, C - she doesn't look like
a sleeping beauty she has spasticity so

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,520
after six years or however long it was
that we had her being in this stage she

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,469
would have twisted limbs, so instead of
the cross-questioning about what do you

11
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,890
think somebody in a vegetative state looks
like "wrong! wrong! wrong!", I go, go on then

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,370
finish his story about something a
vegetative state, and you answer all my

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,550
questions about what you think somebody
in a vegetative state is like and you get

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,430
it wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong, but
I've got in writing now, and I've got it

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,710
in as in the shape of a story. 
Matt: Celia Kitzinger is one of my academic

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,710
icons.
She was the PhD supervisor of my old

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,990
supervisor, so maybe I feel there's a bit
of academic ancestry there. But I really

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,549
feel a lot of my thinking, my approach to
research, and even the methods I adopt

19
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,229
have been in part formed by her work. She
was one of the first to talk about

20
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,250
social constructionism in relation to
what was known as lesbian and gay

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,920
psychology in the 1980s, now more
commonly referred to as LGBT psychology

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,659
and was a leading developer of discourse
and conversation analytic approaches in

23
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,670
relation to the study of gender and
sexuality. But for me what sets it apart

24
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,509
is her staunch activism and commitment
to human rights.

25
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,350
Celia went to the High Court to get an
overseas marriage with her wife,

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,240
Professor Sue Wilkinson, legally
recognized, which finally came about with

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,640
the same-sex marriage act 2013. More
recently she co-founded the Coma and

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,840
Disorders of Consciousness Research
Center, after her sister Polly was

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,920
catastrophically brain injured in a car
accident, and this research in

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,060
collaboration with her sister Professor
Jenny Kitzinger focuses particularly on

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,910
the socio-legal issues surrounding the
treatment of people in

32
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,310
and minimally conscious states. I met
with Celia in July to discuss her work.

33
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,210
After pioneering a social
constructionist approach with her PhD

34
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,860
the social construction of lesbianism, I
was particularly interested in how she

35
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,430
now thinks about epistemology in
relation to her current research

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,580
interests. Celia: I think this place for just
not worrying about epistemology and

37
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,010
getting on with doing your interviews
and listening to what people are saying

38
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,920
and treating them not as true but as
good enough to be treated as true

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,180
because that's where what you've got
so I've done with Jenny I've done I

40
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,080
think it's close to 100 now interviews
with family members of people in

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,710
vegetative and minerally conscious
states saying tell tell me what happened

42
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:08,530
and they start with the cycling accident
or the stroke and they tell me what the

43
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,770
person looked like when they first saw
them in intensive care and they tell me

44
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,650
what happened when they were moved to
high dependency and they described the

45
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,610
eye-opening moment and they talk about
the awfulness of the lung infections and

46
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:27,850
their hope for recovery and their hope
gradually fading, they talk about the

47
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,530
nurses who cared and gave fantastic
loving care they talk about the nurses

48
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,490
who didn't care and they talk about the
physiotherapy and the splints to

49
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,570
straighten their limbs and the horror of
the tilt table which is like a sort of

50
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,680
crucifixion thing that you tilt somebody
up right on, they talk about the smart

51
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,740
testing they talk about whether they
agree or disagree with the doctor's

52
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,880
diagnosis. You know what, I'm not very
interested in whether right that's

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,840
essentialist or social constructionist, I
largely report it as this is what people

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,820
said, and frankly, I know people will
forgotten certain things and in moments

55
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,080
of high emotion have misunderstood or
misremembered others but here's what

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,300
here's what they experience, and I pretty,
we pretty much present that as evidence

57
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,470
of what families go through, and
the value of that is you take that data

58
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,239
to the medical profession and to the
lawyers and you say "This is what

59
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,220
families experience" okay so you didn't
know that families experience it this

60
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,940
way we're telling you.
And for sure they sometimes say, "I'm sure

61
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,390
it didn't happen that way because uh
because doctors wouldn't have done that

62
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,500
because" or "that doesn't make sense, that
medical procedure he's describing can't

63
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,030
have been done like that" yeah, okay, so
yeah that, not everything in interviews is

64
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,560
going to be right but there's enough, and
again it it's about cumulation of the

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,270
same things over and over, so this
accumulation of families saying for

66
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,660
example. "they they said he would be
disabled, but I had no idea what they

67
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,050
meant by that, I thought you'd been a
wheelchair or something this is not

68
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:05,470
disability, this is, this is devastation"
and we get versions of that in over and

69
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,200
over and over a we're in interviews that
doctors somehow are failing to

70
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,180
communicate to families in the early
days what the outcome of that kind of

71
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,020
brain injury will be. Well I'm really
frankly not very interested in whether

72
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,210
that's his social constructionist or you
know how that, the fact is if lots of

73
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,930
families say that to us and I take the
fact that lots of families say that to

74
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,330
us to doctors, doctors start thinking
"we're not explaining this very well, we

75
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,770
should try harder what would work better?"
How, how can we communicate to families

76
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:42,220
the level of devastation that this kind
of brain injury brings, without seeming

77
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,930
to, you know, terrify them and and and
make claims that can't be supported on

78
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,130
the one hand if the patient does
actually recover, but you know how do you

79
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,700
communicate that level of disability, and
that's a helpful discussion and that

80
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,180
actually moves things forward and that
helps families. So, stuff all the epistemo-

81
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,600
that's why I'm inpatient with, what
exactly is the epistemological status of

82
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,030
that data, its value is in communicating
to doctors you need to do this job

83
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,080
better. And, and it works to do that it
does work to do that so that's really

84
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,360
important, but, having said that so that's
the, I don't mind doing positivist

85
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,990
interviewing now it works. There's the
issue of how you translate what you find

86
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,640
in your data, into something that
communicates with people in a way that

87
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:34,060
an academic journal article doesn't.
So one of the things that I'm interested

88
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:40,840
in, and have worked with Jenny on, is
translating research findings, and they

89
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,840
are all qualitative actually, into
stories that can be told to audiences

90
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,100
who can engage with them at a different
kind of level, from from the academic

91
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,640
article or a summary of an academic
article, or an "easy read" version of an

92
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,070
academic article, or an academic talk, so
we've done puppet shows, shadow

93
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,340
puppets, so we got a puppet show person
to- these were actually from our

94
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,072
interviews, so our interviews were audio
recorded like this one is being, with permission to use the audio, and

95
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:13,500
to the sound of clips of audio, we have the

96
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,170
shadow puppets, we have Icarus falling
out of the sky and bumping his head

97
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,540
rather hard
we have Icarus being taken in an

98
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,570
ambulance that's what this is all
shadows a shadow ambulance

99
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,570
"doo-doo doo-doo" to a hospital, we have
Icarus in bed with a bandaged head we

100
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,370
have relatives visiting and leaning over
and the whole thing's takes 20 minutes

101
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:39,130
and it was a professional shadow artist
who created the show based on our

102
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,870
Matt: Based on the audio. Celia: based on our audio
recordings and our analysis of them so

103
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,680
we'd written the analysis of them
already of what sort of trajectory of

104
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,760
families is like, and then we had
permission for her to use some of the

105
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,770
audio so we selected out the audio to go
with it, and so she's created a

106
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:03,610
20-minute show which you sit in a
darkened room and she puts it on and we

107
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,410
have a discussion period of up to an
hour afterwards, and we've shown that in

108
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:15,670
care homes, hospitals, rehab centers to
families and practicing clinicians as

109
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,750
well, and it's a way of conveying, so I
think that's innovative

110
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,240
I think that's managing to convey
qualitative data in new ways. We've also

111
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,210
done the health talk thing which you
may have seen which is clips video clips

112
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,640
from our interviews, online, so families
can sit at home and look at them and we've

113
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,149
used those in training and education,
we've got sonnets, I don't know if you've

114
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:42,370
seen those? Matt: No. Celia: We commissioned a poet James Nash he's a quite well-known

115
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,080
northern poet, to write some sonnets for
us, and he's done three sonnets about

116
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,940
brain injury and recovery or death
following brain injury, which, which we

117
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,339
got some funding to set to music
so there's films of him reading them and

118
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:02,589
and set to music and, and sort of nice
background trees and leaves and flowers

119
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:11,100
and things, we've done, we've asked
families to write their own messages to

120
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:18,339
doctors, social workers, lawyers
themselves, the patient, anyone, on

121
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:23,260
postcards, so we've got a postcard exhibition
which we display, when we're giving talks

122
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,160
just literally, just families written
postcards for things like you know "We

123
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,870
are her family listen to us, trust us, you
don't know her, we do" that sort of thing

124
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:38,320
Umm, yeah and Jenny's done this 
radio program of between the ears which

125
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,580
is soundscapes associated with brain
injuries all of those are ways of taking

126
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,200
what we know about brain injury, which
comes directly from our research, and

127
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,020
translating it into forms of,
communicating, I don't know

128
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:58,600
the emotional truth of it and, the
the lived reality of it, yeah the lived

129
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,110
reality stuff discourses! The lived reality
of it in a way that people who are

130
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:11,080
making decisions either clinical or
judicial, can engage with in a different

131
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,180
kind of way. So I think that's where I
think the innovation is needed it's less

132
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,380
in arguing about the details of
particular research methods, and more in

133
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,610
thinking about if we want these, if we
want our findings to have an effect in

134
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,589
the world how do we communicate those to
people. Matt: With this adoption of creative

135
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,970
ways of communicating qualitative
research, I wondered whether Celia had

136
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,130
ever had trouble in having it recognized
as 'academic' However she explained to me

137
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,779
that with the university's emphasis on
'impact', she'd actually found quite the

138
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,899
opposite. Celia: One of the great,
amazingly wonderful things

139
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:52,329
my academic career is most of my career,
the political work that I did the policy

140
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:58,139
to related work that I did was
considered not part of my academic

141
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,639
existence it was in fact slightly grubby
hands, you know, my job was to produce

142
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,819
research and it was up to the rest of
the world to decide whether it was

143
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:10,119
interesting and whether they wanted to
use it for anything, but I was, it was

144
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:13,660
pure ivory tower stuff when I started so
the fact that I was involved in first in

145
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,730
lesbian and gay politics, and now in
policy change around brain injury has

146
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,420
just been, oh and same-sex marriage
stuff, when I was doing that the

147
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,899
university issued a statement saying
that they they understood that I was

148
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:30,459
involved in same-sex marriage act-, a
legal same-sex marriage case and that

149
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,149
they wished it to be known that "they did
not support it nor did they oppose it

150
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:41,949
they were entirely neutral". So it-
during my academic lifetime that has so

151
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:47,649
shifted from being, disreputable evening
a weekend stuff, we know you do it but

152
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,879
this is not part of your academic work,
towards it being impact, and something

153
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,809
you send off to the Ref, and obviously
I'm an impact case study for this

154
00:11:55,809 --> 00:12:00,790
department, and that has been wholly
positive from my point of view it has

155
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,309
not changed what I do, at all, I still do
what I do, in the way that I want to do

156
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:10,029
it, the only way in which it has changed
what I do is think give me money to do

157
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,860
it so that kind of that kind of
encourages me and gives me more scope to

158
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,230
do what I want to do. so for me the
impact agenda has been wonderful

159
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,879
Matt: Often I think about the concept of impact as
being abstract and unobtainable, but I

160
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,079
was challenged by Celia, as impact just
seems to be a natural byproduct of her

161
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:34,360
work. I was interested in how Celia
demonstrates this impact. Celia: Basically we we

162
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,850
don't spend a lot of time capturing
impact it's more it's more that we spend

163
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,410
a lot of time doing the things that we
think will create change in the world in

164
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,959
the way that we think change needs to be
created and then we see the changes

165
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:56,030
happening like we get, like we give a talk
in a care home about

166
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:00,080
the fact that treatment best interest
decisions need to be made about feeding

167
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,440
tubes and this care home has never made a best
interest decision about a feeding tube

168
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,590
and then four weeks later they phone up
and say they've made some best

169
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,910
interest decisions and will we come and
talk to the families, so you know that or

170
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,990
we say that we think something called
Practice Direction 9E which is part of

171
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,670
the quarter protection practice
directions is wrong we write a

172
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,350
document that it's wrong we tell some
lawyers and solicitors and judges that

173
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,490
we think it's wrong, I got invited to
talk to do some continuing professional

174
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,320
development training with judges and
yesterday I was at a meeting at which

175
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,980
they were going to shall we shall we
abolish Practice Direction 9E, this

176
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,420
doesn't seem right, so you know I'll be
able to point to first there was

177
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,360
Practice Direction 9E which I thought
was wrong, I said it was wrong, and now

178
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,710
there isn't it isn't there anymore, so I
wasn't the only person who was saying it

179
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:55,310
was wrong, but I was one of them, and those
sorts of things make a difference, I mean the bigger

180
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,220
question is how do you make a difference
in the world ,and can you prove it was

181
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,510
just you, no you can't prove it was
just you, can you show cause and effect, I

182
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,830
pressed this button and this thing went
bing! Nope, but you can show that you were

183
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,390
part of how social change works in a
sociological sense which is multiple

184
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:16,220
different forces coming to bear on
trying to create a change. Matt: Over 20 years

185
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,330
ago Celia wrote a paper with an
undergraduate student using the story

186
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,770
completion method, which has influenced a
lot of qualitative researchers, including

187
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,810
myself, to use the method. You can hear
about how Celia has used story completion

188
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,350
for research around disorders of
consciousness below, and you can also

189
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,890
hear a short clip at the beginning of
the interview, but I was interested in

190
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,089
hearing generally what celia now thinks
about the story completion method.

191
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:46,520
I think it's a fun method, I'm actually amazed
that something I do with an

192
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,330
undergraduate student to satisfy an
intellectual itch basically, I was just

193
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:55,040
sort of scratching away at a question
what happens if you take data and you

194
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,880
don't interpret it the way that story
completion has regularly been used and

195
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,860
you do it a different way, it's amazing!
That something two decades ago with an

196
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,890
undergraduate should have been seen as
fundamental to a- and it was an old

197
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,090
method then, I'm a dying method then, 
what is all this new excitement about

198
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,950
story completion? I'm slightly bemused!

199
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,020
Actually, to answer my own question,
I think partly it points to the poverty

200
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:30,310
of methods that we have as qualitative
researchers. Matt: Ok talk a bit about what do mean by poverty of methods.

201
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,060
Celia: Well there haven't been any radical new
innovative methods that I know of

202
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,830
actually when I was doing um Q
methodology for my PhD,

203
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,010
Personal Construct Theory was like "oh we're all
getting excited about Personal Construct Theory

204
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:49,630
that seems to completely died, I think
it's fundamentally unsatisfactory to

205
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:56,000
collect qualitative data, because there
are too many ways in which we know that

206
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,200
we're not getting it I don't know what
to call it

207
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,560
the truth about the world, and we know
we're not allowed to think that there's

208
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,370
a truth about the world either,
so we're uncertain about what we're

209
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:15,110
doing... We all know that none of the
methods that we use are perfect for

210
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,820
finding out what's happening in the
world let alone for putting the world to

211
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,190
rights, so I think we're all fairly
desperate to think perhaps this method

212
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,930
perhaps that method, that method, let's
find a new one, and I think I've been

213
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,100
around long enough to see people looking
for different new ones, and sometimes

214
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,030
finding old ones, and trying to reinvent
them to meet today's contingencies

215
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:45,500
and that's fine, but in the end it leaves me
thinking I'll just stick with, I'll just

216
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:52,250
stick with interviews!
Matt: Really? Because I- in my head

217
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,900
you're characterised by let's step away
from interviews. Celia: See I've been doing

218
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,250
nothing but interviews for the last
three years! Matt: But it's this this

219
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,960
return to, because the way you-
I suppose with disorders of

220
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,090
consciousness is sort of natural, but it
is it is almost giving voice...

221
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:17,170
Celia: Giving voice yes! Matt: but which is a-a
problematic, I mean you're not blindly

222
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,220
you're not kind of objectively giving
voice to people

223
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,130
but has your... Celia: They say I am, they
say, you know, that's fantastic you you're

224
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,789
bearing witness to what we're going
through, bearing witness and giving voice

225
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:34,620
are phrases that are quite often used and
I feel proud to hear that I am bearing

226
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,179
witness and giving voice and those are
phrases that I precisely used in that

227
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:45,929
article I did with Sue Wilkinson called
validating women's voices which was a

228
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:54,510
methodological critique of exactly that
perspective, so... Matt: so it's not a problematic

229
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,750
concept for you giving voice? Celia: It's
problematic in all sorts of ways, I want

230
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,049
people to have their own voices I don't
want to give somebody else a voice I

231
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,710
don't want that to be a world in which
that's necessary

232
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,130
not to mention the fact that if you
filter your voice through mine it's

233
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,470
gonna get distorted on the way out, to a
greater or lesser degree

234
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm not epistemologically naive about
that and I know about the power dynamics

235
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,510
that are involved in attempting to
enable other people to speak through you

236
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,710
through one's own writing and speech,
it's one of the reasons I think that we

237
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,250
wanted to put the filmed interviews on a
website and as part of the purpose of

238
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,880
the shadow artistry, because that's
actually people's own voices

239
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,280
it's literally their breath coming out
and their sound, but even so we've

240
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,840
selected it we've shaped it we've
decided on the order as much, as you do

241
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,270
when you put quotes in an in a in an
article, although it is literally their

242
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:05,760
voice, it's you know, five minutes from a
two-hour interview, so yeah um, and we do

243
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,419
get a lot of pub- what you call it,
participant validation you go back to

244
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,100
the participant to say you know we've
y'know we had families with brain injuries on

245
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,880
all of our steering groups and advisory
panels and, and of course we are a family

246
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
with somebody with a brain injury
although our experience is not

247
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,120
everyone's experience, but these, these
arguments get rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed

248
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,390
these, these are concerns that can
paralyse you, you can, you can end up

249
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:41,500
just worrying about politics and theory
and epistemology and not do anything

250
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:48,780
because there isn't an answer, at least not one
I've found in 30 more, 30-plus years of

251
00:19:48,780 --> 00:20:00,440
doing research, so... I've forgot what the question was
Matt: Well do people get bogged- because

252
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,400
you wrote about how you stopped using Q methodology
because people focused more on the method than

253
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:16,960
the topic. Celia: Yes Matt: So, do you think that uhh
yeah it can detract from the findings

254
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,330
when you use these... Celia: Yeah I mean
one of the nice things about interviews

255
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,990
is virtually everything that can be said
about interviews has been said, we're

256
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,640
running out arguments about them, so we have
very little discussion about our research

257
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,740
methodology now that we're
using interviews, whereas with with Q

258
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,780
methodology it was endless and tedious
with focus groups, see Jenny, Jenny used

259
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,260
to be a really big user of focus groups
and is quite well known for as a focus

260
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,100
group researcher, she's done a couple of
books on focus groups she was

261
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,890
instrumental in, she wrote a very famous
massively cited article on focus groups

262
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,650
for sensitive topics because people said
you couldn't do focus groups on

263
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,980
sensitive topics and she was researching
things that hiv/aids and child sexual

264
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,410
abuse and things with prisoners and she
was going yes you can, look... We're not

265
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,000
using focus groups, so we b- we both
actually have written an awful lot on

266
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,100
methodology, because we sort of
thought somehow somewhere there would be

267
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:22,990
the right way or a better way or a
valuable way of doing it, and I guess the

268
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:31,770
driving burning ambition now is how can
how... there is a problem with the world

269
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,800
these people's rights are being abused.
How can I find out

270
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,690
why that's happening and how can I
challenge it and put it right, and that

271
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:48,950
that overrides everything else and
actually just asking people tell me

272
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:55,370
what's happening, is... and hearing what
they say and treating it in a

273
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,929
non-ironical way
while bearing in mind that's just one

274
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:05,140
version... and reporting here's
what they say, it just seems like a

275
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,150
simple way of doing what I want to do
which is stop human rights abuses, of

276
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,830
these very vulnerable patients and their
families. Matt: So that's it! Hope our chat has

277
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,160
given you some things to think about and
I'm looking forward to seeing your

278
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,880
thoughts and comments.
