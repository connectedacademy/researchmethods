## Preparation

In advance of this class author Susan Stellin and photographer Graham Macindoe challenge us to create a 4Corners image that depicts addiction in a way that goes beyond the typical images we see. Use the appropriate corners to include supporting images, a backstory, any relevant links, your code of ethics and a copyright notice.
