Walking, cycling. The summer of 2011, David had been cycling and the bag he was wearing over his shoulder had come loose, entangled in the front wheel of his bicycle and he had been thrown over the handlebars, face-first to the road, breaking his upper jaw and neck in two places. “I was choking on the blood,” he told me.\nDavid was taken to the hospital; bones mended, wounds healed, but the obstruction of a feeding and air tube in his mouth prevented his being able to alert nurses or doctors that his sight had vanished for almost a week after awaking from the coma.\n“One of the strangest things is waking up from a dream. In dreams I can still see. I can see everything. I wake and feel I can still see for a time, then the black seeps in and I realise I am awake and in darkness again, where the reality used to be filled with sight, now my dreams are. Where sleep was without light, now that’s my waking life. Everything is upside down. Now being awake is like the dream. My awake nightmare”\nMeeting regularly, David and I, in early 2012 began working upon the first installment of an ongoing series of stories about his life with blindness. The challenging new day to day routines, learning routes into town with his stick or following behind his mother, Eugene.","author":"Jim Mortram","publication":"Vantage","publicationUrl":"https://medium.com/vantage/postcards-from-the-black-f705f9097b","date":"October 17, 2015"},"creativeCommons":{"credit":"Jim Mortram","year":"2015","copyright":"All rights reserved","codeOfEthics":"Photojournalist","description":"David standing in Southburgh church, Norfolk."}}</script>
