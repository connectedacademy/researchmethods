Anyone can access the learning materials for free once they have been published. Accessing them via the Talking Pictures Platform means you can see when and where organised classes are running. You can “join” a class by choosing it as your local _Hub_. The interface enables you to see other participant’s notes, to comment on them and make your own. You can also choose to give and receive feedback from your _Hub_-peers on any submitted images.
 
The Talking Pictures Platform organises content like a playlist. Each class’s audio content are in fact audio-montages edited from 3 or 4 different interviews so you can choose between the essential playlist or the longer, extended versions. A supplementary series of deep-dive podcasts, which address the course’s key questions directly, are also available, .
 
The classes have four phases. Phase one, you are invited to produce photographic response to a provocation, for example for lesson 1 you’re asked to: “Tell me the story of something that isn’t there”
Phase two is when your Hub's materials go live. This is when you need to make notes and comments via the Talking Pictures Platform.
Phase three is time to use the platform to review everyone's notes and collate a reflective edit of them.<[link to storify example](https://storify.com/Jonathan_Worth/photographer-ian-macdonald-by-jamie-macdonald)>
Phase four is a revisiting of your initial photograph and sharing a final updated, or new version.  <this might be better as a diagram?>
 
Before you start the course, you’ll be required to answer a few questions. This is because 'Interpretation' is also a PhD research project<link to ABOUT page>. We want to know if the design of the content and the platform, help people to teach and learn, in, and of digital spaces. All of the answers and any other data are anonymised, so your learning journey will not be associated with you personally.  None of the data gathered will be shared with any third parties and all research outcomes will be published for [Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access).
